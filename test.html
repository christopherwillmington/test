<h1>Web Accessibility Initiative</h1>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/">Writing for Web Accessibility</a>
<p>For each web page, provide a short title that describes the page content and distinguishes it from other pages. The page title is often the same as the main heading of the page. Put the unique and most relevant information first; for example, put the name of the page before the name of the organization. For pages that are part of a multi-step process, include the current step in the page title.</p>
<p>Use short headings to group related paragraphs and clearly describe the sections. Good headings provide an outline of the content.</p>
<p>Write link text so that it describes the content of the link target. Avoid using ambiguous link text, such as ‘click here’ or ‘read more’. Indicate relevant information about the link target, such as document type and size, for example, ‘Proposal Documents (RTF, 20MB)’.</p>
<p>For every image, write alternative text that provides the information or function of the image. For purely decorative images, there is no need to write alternative text.</p>
<p>For audio-only content, such as a podcast, provide a transcript. For audio and visual content, such as training videos, also provide captions. Include in the transcripts and captions the spoken information and sounds that are important for understanding the content, for example, ‘door creaks’. For video transcripts, also include a description of the important visual content, for example ‘Athan leaves the room’.</p>
<p>Ensure that instructions, guidance, and error messages are clear, easy to understand, and avoid unnecessarily technical language. Describe input requirements, such as date formats.</p>
